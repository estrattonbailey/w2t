# w2t
Tiny asynchronous action timer. **150 bytes gzipped.**

### Install
```
npm i w2t --save
```

### What is this?
Sometimes UI actions feel more human if we delay them instead of allowing them to
be completed at computer time. `w2t` allows you to specify actions and a *minimum*
time for them to be completed before the `Promise` is resolved.

If your specified action(s) take longer than the minimum, `w2t` will wait for
all actions to complete before resolving.

# Usage
`w2t` is a thin wrapper around `Promise.all`, so the API is essentially the
same: resolved values are returned on an array, with order preserved.

Below, `w2t` will resolve `foo` and `baz`, but wait 500 ms before returning.
```javascript
import wait from 'w2t'

const foo = async () => 'bar'
const baz = async () => 'qux'

wait(500, [ foo, baz ]).then(([ resolvedFoo, resolvedBaz ]) => {
  console.log(resolvedFoo, resolveBaz) // 'bar qux'
})
```

If no actions are provided, `w2t` becomes useful as a "sleep" function.
```javascript
// do something

await wait(600)

// do something 600ms later
```
